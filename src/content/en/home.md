# Welcome to Faith & Home

Allentown faces a housing crisis. Rents have jumped 45% since 2020, and more than half of our neighbors struggle to afford their homes. At the same time, many local churches are navigating declining membership and underused buildings. *Faith & Home* brings these challenges together into a solution: transforming under-utilized church properties into affordable homes while keeping congregations vital and mission-focused.

### Building Together

What makes *Faith & Home* different? We’re not just building housing— we’re building consensus and understanding within congregations and neighborhoods. When a church faces change, its members confront profound questions about identity, legacy, and mission. *Faith & Home* honors these decisions through storytelling and community conversation. We’re conducting oral history interviews with congregants, 
faith leaders, and neighbors—creating space for people to share their memories, values, and hopes for the future.

Through design workshops and community dialogues, we help 
congregations understand how their properties can continue serving their 
mission of caring for neighbors. Storytelling transforms abstract policy 
into lived experience, helping communities discern together what’s possible and what’s right. We believe the best solutions emerge when 
communities lead the process.

Our pilot project will create 6-12 affordable rental homes on a church 
site, blending housing with worship and community spaces. We’ve applied for state funding to make this vision real by 2026.

## A Partnership Rooted in Community

*Faith & Home* is a collaboration between the ***Lehigh Conference of Churches*** and *Lehigh University's* ***Small Cities Lab***.

The *Small Cities Lab* builds upon local knowledge to develop best practices, policy frameworks, and scalable solutions for small cities that are chronically under-studied and under-resourced.

Since May 2024, we’ve been working with congregations across Allentown—
including Redeemer Lutheran, St. Timothy Lutheran, First Presbyterian, The Barn, and Church of the Mediator—to explore how their land and buildings can serve our community’s housing needs.
